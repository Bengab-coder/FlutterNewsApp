# FlutterNewsApp

A simple new app made with flutter. When I made this project I didnt know much about git and github, so now I've known how to use github and git, I have uploaded all the files. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Building an apk 
First make sure you have this repository clonned, then navigate into the project directory and run `flutter run`
This should build the app in debug mode.
